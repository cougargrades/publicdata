       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      An interdisciplinary undergraduate seminar examining the ways in which the arts impact and interact with culture, society and place. Team-taught by McGovern College of the Arts faculty members from the Art, Music, Theatre, and Dance departments, the course will focus on a global city, country, or region as a context for analyzing how the arts impact the historical and sociocultural lives of people at various moments throughout history. In the mini-semester immediately following the course, an optional learning-abroad unit will be offered during which students and faculty will travel to and experience first-hand the city, country, or region that formed the focus of the seminar.
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Note:
      </strong>
      Optional Study Abroad experience related to course content will be offered in the following mini-term.
