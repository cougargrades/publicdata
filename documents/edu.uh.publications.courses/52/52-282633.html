       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This course exposes students to issues of culture, identity, history and political economy of the Himalayas including Northeast India, Indian Western Himalayas, Bhutan, Nepal, sections of Pakistan and Afghanistan, Tibet, Northern Bangladesh and Myanmar. Through reading and engagement with anthropological literature on The Himalayas the course will highlight why the Himalayas as a region was such a preoccupation as the discipline of Anthropology evolved to its present state. As the region continued to be a site of tremendous anthropological attention the course will be exploring several key theoretical, historical and methodological issues within the discipline of anthropology as we learn about places and people in the region. will be paid to the area as a site for negotiating identity (caste and indigeneity), development politics, social movements, music, animals and current political tensions in the region. At the conclusion of the class, students should have a stronger idea of the important role this area has played in the political, religious and social imagination of the world and an appreciation of concepts such as ritual theory, social movements, modernity and gender studies.
