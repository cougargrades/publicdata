       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This asynchronous course trains students to reason morally about cultural issues defining our time. It examines theories and questions of ethics at the intersection of different cultural and religious backgrounds, ethnicities, genders, sexualities, and social classes. Specifically, students will learn how to recognize and avoid discrimination and inequality, ponder their decisionsâ€™ social and environmental consequences, and succeed in complex, multicultural contexts by conducting their lives according to ethically justifiable principles and norms.
