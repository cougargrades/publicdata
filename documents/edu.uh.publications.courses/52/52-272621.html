      This course is a study of dance in cinematic media from early Hollywood movie musicals to contemporary cinema with a specific focus on dance as a non-verbal form of communication to express emotion and develop plot.  The curriculum addresses current issues as seen through the lens of dance on film.  Such topics include racism in Hollywood, gender and politics, and urban renewal. Assignments include readings, video viewings, scene analysis, group assignments, quizzes, and a video submission.
