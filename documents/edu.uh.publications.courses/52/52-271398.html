       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This course will emphasize the critical importance of a long-term historical perspective for understanding Houston¿s contemporary environmental challenges. Reading works by natural scientists, social scientists, and historians, we will investigate the geological, hydrological, and ecological history of greater Houston; the development of the city’s infrastructure since 1836, including water, sewage, transportation, and energy systems; the relationship between race, class, gender, and exposure to infectious diseases, industrial pollution, and natural disasters; and the history of environmental activism and the environmental justice movement in Houston.
