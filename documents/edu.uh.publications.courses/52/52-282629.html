      <strong>
       Note:
      </strong>
      ACCT 2305 does not meet the Business Administration and Management Field of Study requirement and cannot be used to satisfy degree requirements for majors in business. Students cannot receive credit for both ACCT 2301 and ACCT 2305.  Therefore, students planning to switch their majors to business should only take ACCT 2301 and ACCT 2302 after they change their majors to business.
