       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Western ideas about Africa often centralize medical crises. From missionary ideologies of hygiene to the dissemination of HIV education in sub-Saharan Africa, medicine and health have often linked the African continent with other parts of the world but always positioning Africans in crisis. While this course, examines health, healing, and medicine in the African continent over the last two centuries, its focus is on African healers and patients before, during, and after the colonial period. Our attention will be on the relationship between western and non-western forms of scientific practice and health systems that emerged on the continent. Students in this class will acquire knowledge of the history and practice of public health in Africa through a wide range of readings much of which are anchored in history.
