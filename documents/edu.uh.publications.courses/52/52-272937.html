       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Production, distribution, consumption, and accumulation of resources or pursuit of wealth, prosperity, improvement, and happiness always have cultural underpinnings. While many theorists see Capitalism and Culture as opposites, the increasing economic and political importance of Asia disproves the idea that cultural particularities are hindrances to the flourishing of capitalism. Asian countries, which were colonized by European nations, are not simply sites for the outsourcing of manufacturing and service industries but also centers of innovation and new businesses. Cultural variables, such as kinship, social networks, self-understanding or identities, nationalism, loyalty, and charismatic power have played a key but less recognized role in the economic life of all nations and in Asia. This course will help students understand how these variables affect each other and shape the economic actions of individuals in the emerging economies of Asia with particular focus on India (Asiaâ€™s largest democracy)
