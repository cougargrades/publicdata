      Some have said that American democracy is only fifty years old. What they mean is that American multiracial democracy¿where nonwhites have some power at the ballot box, and enjoy a significant degree of inclusion in economic and educational opportunity¿began in the decades after the passage of the Civil and Voting Rights Acts of 1964. The Trump years, the Insurrection of January 6, and its aftermath, have revealed the precarity of minority political gains, and the lengths to which opponents of multiracial democracy will go to destroy them.
