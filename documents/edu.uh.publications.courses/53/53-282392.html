      This course develops student self-sufficiency for continuously improving their communication abilities. Students explore how to improve written, oral, and visual communication skills; practice editing their work; adjust their messaging; give feedback to others; and engage in improving communication. Students practice writing to learn and to effectively communicate. While the primary emphasis is on writing, students also practice speaking their message and arguments, as well as visually presenting information.
