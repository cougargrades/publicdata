      The course will deal with the origin and present status of the 1972 National Coastal Zone Management Act and subsequent coastal management programs adopted by virtually all coastal states. The Texas program is administered by the General Land Office and will be dealt with in depth as the central focus of the course. Statutory law relating to citizen, state, and federal rights and duties as they impact coastal law will be studied as a part of Texas real property law. Cases relating to those rights and duties and Public Trust Doctrine cases are an integral part of understanding the responsibilities of governments and rights of citizens. The course should help prepare an attorney to advise clients concerning their rights and responsibilities, as well as permit procedures and limitations applicable to the coast.
