      This course will immerse students in practical business and legal concepts inherent in commercial financing transactions and demonstrate how those issues manifest themselves in the financing documents drafted by lawyers. Students will learn the provisions of financing documents, and, importantly, learn the legal and business issues behind the provisions. The tools and concepts taught in class lectures will be implemented by students in practice through negotiation and drafting of a commercial loan utilizing real world current forms of a syndicated credit agreement and term sheet.
