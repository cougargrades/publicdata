      This course will consider the role of modern business corporations in society. Should corporations be run exclusively in the interests of shareholders? How should boards of directors manage the claims of various groups affected by corporations? By what standards should we judge executive compensation? Should corporations be entitled to claim various constitutional rights, including freedoms of speech, association, and religion? After surveying foundational work in corporate theory, we will address these questions through a close reading of materials in law, economics, political theory, and business ethics.
