      This course analyzes the conditions of immaterial labour in the context of the precarious financialization of the present time, particularly inside a crisis provoked by a debt as growing as it is unpayable. It pays special attention to the ways in which writing as labour   ̶   its use and exchange values, its semiotics and aesthetics   ̶  subvert or try to subvert the status quo, rather than confirming it. The course will analyze the role of the University in contexts of contemporary capitalist production and, from then on, the diverse forms of critique and struggle that bind us, as writers and citizens, to others. The course will also critically analyze communalist means of existence and production, whose ecology might very well become the hospitable space for writing-in-connection-with-others and in a perpetual standing alertness. Students will design and execute a community writing project.
