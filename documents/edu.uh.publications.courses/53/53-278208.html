      The goal of the Community Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience (IPPE) is to provide opportunities for students to integrate, apply, reinforce the knowledge, skills, attitudes, abilities, and behaviors acquired through didactic education and apply them in direct patient care activities in the community setting. Through the Community IPPE, preceptors facilitate student learning by guiding students in the achievement of course proficiencies, which are designed to make the student competent in all technical and dispensing activities, while also introducing them to higher level patient-oriented practice in a community pharmacy setting. Using the Joint Commission of Pharmacy Practitioners (JCPP) Pharmacist Patient Care Process, students will actively participate in direct patient care, including but not limited to drug distribution process, collaborate with other healthcare professionals in making patient care decisions, and ensure appropriate medication therapy administration process.
