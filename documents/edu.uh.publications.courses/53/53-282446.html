      Policies to overcome poverty and inequality require political coalitions to sustain them. This course provides analytical frameworks from rational choice theory to historical institutionalism to understand how variations in formal institutions (constitutions, regimes, and the state) and informal institutions (religion, race/ethnicity and family ties) originate, persist, and impact development and inequality.
