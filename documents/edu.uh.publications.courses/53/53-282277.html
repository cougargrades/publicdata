      This course introduces two and three-dimensional fluid mechanics problems. Topics include classical analytical methods and modern computational methods that explain the capabilities of personal computers and available computational resources. The goal of this course is an industry-ready knowledge of flow past complex bodies, boundary layers, and numerical techniques that have become a design tool in many engineering systems.
