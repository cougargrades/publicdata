      Students learn of the formulaic dimensions of the literature created by Spanish-language writers who have immigrated to the United States, its typical and stereotypical characters and messages. The discussion also involves the relationship of immigrant literature to the national myths of the “melting pot”, the American Dream, assimilation, as well as the dream of returning to the homeland. Of overriding interest is the authors’ attempts to “write the nation”. The students learn to manage the technological and bibliographic resources needed for research in the field of Hispanic immigrant literature and for writing a final, publishable paper.
