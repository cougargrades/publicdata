      This course focuses on the paradigmatic works of a group of authors of Dominican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban origin who promote their work in Spanish, English, and Spanglish, but always from the United States. The place of enunciation of their fictional subjects belongs to a world full of fractures, longings, and overflows that fits so well with the vision of the “fractal Caribbean”, as Édouard Glissant established it. The highly politicized texts illuminate the variety of the Hispanic-Caribbean heritage in the United States.
