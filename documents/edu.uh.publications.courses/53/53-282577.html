      This course provides an introduction to different theoretical approaches to bi-/multilingualism and language representation in the bilingual mind. We will focus on how different language components develop in bilinguals, with an emphasis on lexicon and syntax and their interfaces. Research that examines these phenomena will be discussed with a special focus on Spanish as a heritage language and on bilingual varieties of Spanish resulting from language contact, both in the Americas and elsewhere. This course will be delivered following a face-to-face format in combination with assignments to be completed online. The course will be conducted in Spanish and will consist mainly of lectures, selected readings, in-class discussions, and online assignments, as well as an original research project. Readings will be in English and Spanish. Discussions, assignments, and research projects can be completed in English or Spanish.
