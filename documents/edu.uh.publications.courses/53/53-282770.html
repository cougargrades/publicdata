      This course introduces systems science methods and their uses for examining and applying the principles of infrastructure sustainability. The $2 trillion investment of the federal government for reshaping and overhauling the nationÂ¿s infrastructure can be perceived as a foundational transformation towards a sustainable infrastructure which can improve the environments and outcomes that enhance population health. Students will appreciate the challenges of studying complex systems and the value of a systems lens for developing insight into water, energy, transportation, food systems, and community connectivity. In fact, most contemporary cities have yet to understand the criteria and the extent to which population-level changes can be achieved by the increased investment in infrastructure. The interdisciplinary faculty involved in the course will introduce the intellectual and practical challenges of intervening in complex systems related to infrastructure. We explore how to characterize the human-centered problems that arise and how to handle complexity as a core design and development challenge, particularly when working with stakeholders to address a population health problem. The course does not intend to develop modeling skills in students. The focus is developing a basic facility with the concepts and methods in systems science. Course Notes: The course text is El-Sayed &amp; Galea (editors), Systems Science and Population Health, 2017. We will provide copies of relevant chapters on Canvas.  Chester and Allenby, The Rightful Place of Science: Infrastructure in the Anthropocene. Publisher: Consortium for Science, Policy, and Outcomes. ISBN-10:0999587781.  Additional required readings and supplemental resources are listed on the syllabus and posted on Canvas.   This is a seminar-style course that emphasizes discussion, with minimal lecture.
