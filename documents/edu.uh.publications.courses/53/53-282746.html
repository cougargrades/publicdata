      The purpose of this course is to examine the law and policy of criminal sentencing. The course will explore why society punishes; who holds the power to set sentences (the social institutions); what elements factor into sentencing decisions (offense and offender characteristics); and how sentencing and punishment decisions are made (procedure and proof). The course will also explore the typical outcomes of the sentence decision, including the most expensive and visible outcome: imprisonment. Finally, the course will consider sentencing-review doctrines, including new laws and advocacy surrounding ¿second look¿ sentencing mechanisms, and the role of executive clemency.
