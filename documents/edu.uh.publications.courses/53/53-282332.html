      The course is designed to enable students to understand, critique, and apply current research and theory of practicing public relations with culturally diverse publics (intercultural PR) and in a global setting (global PR). We will discuss basic theories in identity, value orientations, culture, and cultural dimensions as well as best practices at interpersonal level (competences, adjustment and acculturation), intraorganizational level (identifying publics, relationship management, and conflict resolution), and global level.
