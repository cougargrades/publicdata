      This seminar is inspired by the glaring omission of women from positions of power and leadership in the legal profession and beyond. While women continue to enter law school and the legal profession in relatively equal numbers to men, they remain outside of the structures of power—in the judiciary, law firms, the corporate world and even legal education—in the United States and beyond. This reality is even worse for women of color.
