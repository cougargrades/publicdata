      Students will represent clients with asylum cases  ̶  people who are seeking protection in the U.S. because they fear persecution at home on the basis of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in another protected group like a sexual or gender minority. Students, with the guidance of professors, will be responsible for every aspect of representation including client interviewing and counseling, fact investigation and development, document and application drafting, working with expert witnesses, and trial advocacy.
