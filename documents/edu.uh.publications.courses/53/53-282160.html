      This course consists of the systematic study of parallel structures from Spanish and English to identify their differences and similarities. The goal is to apply findings in this area to facilitate the learning of Spanish in an environment in which students deal with two languages in their everyday life. A critical examination of different methodologies, theories, and principles related to the teaching of Spanish as a second language is also part of the larger discussion during the semester, which will allow students to get familiar with the current literature on Spanish Linguistics and second language acquisition. Contrastive analysis of live discourse from real situations is expected from students.
