      This course has two primary goals: (1) to expose students to international arbitration practice; and (2) to provide students with the skills they need to represent clients effectively in international commercial arbitrations. The backbone of the course will be a mock arbitration with the students advocating the entire matter through each stage of the arbitration process.
