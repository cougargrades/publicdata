      Houston Independent School District is the 7th largest school district in the United States, serving over 214,000 students. Combined, Houston-area schools serve nearly 1,000,000 students. The-school-to-prison pipeline is a phenomenon by which students are pushed out of schools and into the juvenile or criminal justice systems. The Education Rights Clinic aims to disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline in the Houston area by  1 providing community outreach in the form of know-your-rights presentations to young people and their families, and 2 providing direct representation to middle and high school students in school disciplinary proceedings.  Through direct representation, law students will have the opportunity to interview clients, investigate facts, create a case plan, conduct legal research, and represent clients directly in school disciplinary proceedings. Depending on the case, this may include a trial-like administrative proceeding in front of a school board with timed opening statements, responses to opposing counsel, and closing statements.
