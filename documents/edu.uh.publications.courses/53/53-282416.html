      This course focuses on medical technology development. Our goal is to expose students to the process of understanding significant unmet medical needs and designing new medical technologies to address them. Students will work in small groups to identify important unmet clinical needs, develop strategies to develop better products or solutions and then prepare business plans for commercializing those products. Through the course, students learn strategies for identifying clinical needs, researching literature, searching patents, understanding intellectual property, regulatory, and reimbursement pathways, performing market assessments, and addressing commercialization and marketing activities.
