      This course will address the fundamental issues of who gets to become a United States citizen, who we will let into the country and under what conditions, and who decides. We will review the underlying assumptions of citizenship and its various dimensions: entry for family and employment purposes, refugee and asylum issues, and international and comparative law fundamentals.
