      Introduces students to health impact assessments (HIA), a systematic approach that informs decision-makers about the potential health impacts of proposed projects, programs, and policies that do not traditionally focus on health outcomes (e.g. education or housing), but are likely to affect population health. The use of HIAs is rapidly growing in the U.S. as one way to assess potential health impacts and promote health equity. This course will focus on the application of HIA for policymaking. Students will study the rationale for conducting HIAs, how HIAs fit within the broader concept of Health in All Policies, review a range of analytic methods used to conduct HIAs, analyze cases from international and domestic settings, and walk through the steps of how to conduct a HIA. Course Notes: Readings will be available online or on Canvas. For each class there will be REQUIRED readings and several optional readings. It is expected that, in addition to the required readings, students will read at least the abstract or executive summary of each of the optional articles and HIA reports listed. Excellent performance involves reading completely at least half of all articles listed and contributing ideas from these readings to the class discussions.
