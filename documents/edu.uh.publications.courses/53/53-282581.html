      Screen Memories examines cinematic works of both Post-War (1939-1975) and Democratic Spain (1975-present), integrating historical, sociological, political, and aesthetic contexts, as well as the history of cinematography as an art form, and the critical analysis of film as artistic expression. The course consists of screening, close study, and analysis of Spanish films. Additional films will be viewed independently. Each screening is accompanied by reading assignments, preceded by a lecture, and followed by a discussion. While readings and lectures aim at presenting the films within their historical, social, and aesthetic contexts, the discussions encourage students to respond critically to it. There will also be readings regularly posted on our open-access online textbook.
