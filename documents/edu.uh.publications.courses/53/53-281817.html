      This course is the second part of a two-semester course. The spring semester will focus on monitoring and participating in health legislation before the Texas 84th Legislature Regular Session. Students will monitor and provide support for the policy proposal developed in the fall semester course, track and report on other health legislation, and follow the actions of health-related committees. Grading will be based on several practical writing assignments (including drafting committee testimony, amendment language, community education article, legislative sponsor’s talking points, committee business tracking, and a health legislative summary). This course satisfies the Skills Course Requirement.
      <br/>
