Class lectures will offer an overview of the history of the peoples of the Iberian Peninsula from prehistoric, times to the present, the major artistic trends (romanesque, gothic, renaissance, baroque, neoclassicism, surrealism, etc.) that influenced Spain and the Spanish artists representative of these schools in the visual arts as well as in literature and political elements that have shaped the concept of a Spanish nation throughout different historical periods, with a special focus on Spain’s peculiar relationship first with the Muslim and Jewish cultures in the Middle Ages, and finally with Western Europe and Latin America.
