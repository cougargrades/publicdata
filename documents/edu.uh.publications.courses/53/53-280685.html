      The goal of this course is to introduce dynamic decision making under uncertainty. We will examine this problem within the Markov Decision Process framework (MDP). MDPs have applications in many areas including supply chain (e.g., inventory, maintenance), revenue management (e.g., hotel, airline, and rental car pricing), financial engineering, manufacturing, and medical decision making. The course will examine the models, theory, and applications of MDPs and their variants (e.g., partially observable MDP, model-free reinforcement learning).
