      The graduate research seminar classes are events that are hosted by the particular research groups. The precise format of each research seminar class is determined by the corresponding research group. Meetings typically take place once per week, to discuss research or participate in seminars in the area of interest to the research group. Students who are being supported to do research should sign up for a research seminar class, signing up for the one that corresponds to their research group.
