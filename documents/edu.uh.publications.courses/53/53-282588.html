      In this seminar workshop, we will use family documents and objects to write/create fiction and non-fiction stories/artifacts. Based on a range of theoretical perspectives, we will interrogate what constitutes a state repository and what is an affective archive, and the role and value of documents they contain or convoke. We will read a strong selection of poets and narrators from the Spanish-speaking world and from U.S.A.-literary traditions  ̶  from Theresa Chá to Julie Carr, from Tim Z. Hernández to Belén López Peiró, from Nona Fernández to Amy Sarah Caroll, among many others  ̶  to examine how they have faced the challenge posed by personal documents and the materiality of the archive in the structuring of their books/pieces and the telling of their stories. This is not a clinic, but a generative workshop, meaning that students will be responding to prompts included on the syllabus as they complete 5 page-long writing samples. Depending on the size of the class, three of these samples will be workshopped per session.
