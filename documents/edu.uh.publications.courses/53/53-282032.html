      This course provides a theoretical and empirical introduction to current research on the family. Students will be introduced to current philosophical debates about parental rights, children’s rights, and family justice, and explore in detail empirical research on the impact of different family policies, including paid parenting leaves, cash and tax subsidies for families with young children, flexible scheduling laws, and publicly-supported childcare, on children and parents.
