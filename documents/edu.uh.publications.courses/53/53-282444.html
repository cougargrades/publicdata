      Students will develop a thorough understanding of the basic theories and principles underlying reservoir simulation. The students will build their own reservoir simulators by applying present approaches for building models of fluid flow and heat transfer in natural porous media systems. Course Notes: Student outcomes of ABET criteria (1), (6) and (7) will be attained. ABET criteria (1): an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics ABET criteria (6): an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions ABET criteria (7): an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.
