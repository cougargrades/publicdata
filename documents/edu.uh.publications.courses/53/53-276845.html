      It covers conceptual and quantitative analysis of watershed processes with an emphasis on hydrologic data analysis and modeling of surface water hydrology processes for water resources management. The study of watershed processes is essential for understanding, restoring, and managing land resources. This focus frequently requires knowledge of interpreting and using watershed data or observations to simulate watershed processes. Such watershed analysis allows for the assessment of land use impacts, water quality, sediment transport, climate change, development of land, and further understanding of watershed processes. This course will provide basic quantitative skills for watershed management and problem-solving using models focused on hydrology and environmental management.
