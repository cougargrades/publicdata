      Topics include: basic concepts and theoretical principles of stable isotopes (fractionation factors, mechanisms of isotopic exchange, etc.), characterization of stable isotope systematics for light elements (C, H, O, N, etc.) in different geological systems, including igneous and metamorphic rocks, waters and marine sediments, hydrothermal systems, biogeochemical systems, and extraterrestrial materials. Case studies and recent development of knowledge in this field will be emphasized.
