      This course will seek to situate constructions of “cultural” and “biological” difference in the context of social inequality and subordination. Specifically, it will examine the social processes by which distinctions and differences of “race’ are produced, reproduced, and transformed, and will do so in relation to the related concepts of “ethnicity,” “culture,” and “nation.” The dynamics of race and racism in the United States stressed, but other parts of the world will be compared.
