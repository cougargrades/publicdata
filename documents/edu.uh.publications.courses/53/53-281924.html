      This course covers Neural Engineering methods used for neural ensemble recording and neural stimulation. Electrodes and devices used in Brain Machine Interfacing (BMI, deep brain stimulation (DBS, spinal cord stimulation (SCS, transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS, and Peripheral Nerve Interfacing will be covered. Advanced techniques including modulation by optogenetics and the development of new voltage fluorescent probes will be explained. The use of neural prosthesis for the restoration of sensory and motor function will be reviewed and Bioelectronic Medicine. This course will help students to understand a wide range of methodology currently use to interrogate and modulate the nervous system.
