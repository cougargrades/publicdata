      This course has one central purpose: to guide you in the production of a final, high quality research project of the student’s choosing. To that end, we will break down the research and writing process into its component parts, working toward the goal of producing a final, cohesive draft of the MA report by the end of the semester.  Reading and writing assignments in early weeks will help you articulate the central issues, questions, and problems of your MA report, allowing you to approach the entire project (to be drafted in later weeks) with a sense of awareness and control.  All writing assignments-in draft, provisional, and final form-will be “workshopped” with the entire group.
