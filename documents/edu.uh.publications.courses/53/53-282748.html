      Throughout history, lawyers have played critical leadership roles in both the public and private sector. In every aspect of American society, lawyers lead and actively serve in leadership capacities in their communities and the legal profession. While leadership training is part of the fabric of law school, specific emphasis and training is important and helpful to adequately equip our graduates with the leadership skills needed in this increasingly-complex and ever-changing professional environment. Recent studies show that an ever-increasing number of employers are seeking graduates with leadership skillsets.
