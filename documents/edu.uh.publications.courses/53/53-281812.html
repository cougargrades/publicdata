      Having a criminal or juvenile delinquency record can create major barriers in obtaining employment, financial aid, housing, public benefits, educational and licensing opportunities, military enlistment, and many other benefits. Most juvenile records and certain adult records can be sealed or removed from an individual’s criminal history, thereby increasing opportunities for employment, education, and more. This course will give law students the opportunity to continue gaining experience in three different types of records clearing procedures: (1) juvenile records sealing; (2) expunctions of adult criminal records; and (3) nondisclosure orders for adult criminal records. Students will have the opportunity to choose which types of records clearing cases they would like to focus on.
