      This course is designed to provide the fundamentals of advanced oxidation processes currently applied, and under development for the remediation of water, wastewater and sludge. The first half of the course is devoted to present an introduction to AOPs and a background to UV photolysis and it’s mathematical modeling.  The second half is focused on individual advanced oxidation processes and selected industrial applications that include drinking water &amp; wastewater treatment, odor treatment and textiles applications.
