      This course is designed to familiarize students with the recent formal literature in international relations, and to aid them in developing and analyzing their own models. Although we will discuss the model building enterprise, much of the course will revolve around discussion and analysis of works that take a formal approach to international relations. Students will both identify the trends and direction of the current literature and pursue their own topics of interest. During the course, we will conduct brainstorming sessions, in which students can discuss ways to formalize their substantive topics or to extend some of the models that we discuss during class. The course will culminate with research presentations by students, in which they demonstrate an ability to apply the formal modeling enterprise to a substantively interesting topic.
