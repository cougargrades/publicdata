      On October 12, 2006, the U.S. Census Bureau predicted that five days later at about 7:46 a.m. (EDT) the U.S. population would reach the historic milestone of 300 million. On that daytime, Emanuel Plata, one of  “America’s 300 millionth baby,” was born in Queens. The son of two immigrants from Puebla, Mexico, Emanuel epitomizes the new demographic reality of the nation: a new melting pot that since the 1970s has been seasoned with immigration flows from Latin America and Asia.

After the 1965 amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act, which abolished the quota system of the 1920s, immigration policy put people of all nations on an “equal footing” by eliminating nationality as an admission criterion. In the following decades, the foreign-born population increased considerably after declining since 1910. The Hart-Celler Act, as it was also known at the time, as well as subsequent immigration laws, opened the United States’  doors to new waves of immigration from non-traditional European regions. 

  -What immigration policy best serves the U.S. national interest today?   	
  -What it will take Congress to discuss and vote a “comprehensive” immigration reform? and what should/could/likely include? 

Throughout this seminar students will develop their own answers to these questions. The course is interdisciplinary by nature, we will draw on political science, economics, sociology, law and public policy literature in order to understand the complexity of immigration.
