      Mediation Advocacy is a simulation, skills-based class that will teach you the art and skill of utilizing mediation to negotiate disputes. Most lawsuits settle and, in Harris County, most courts require participation in mediation before setting a case for trial. This course will: (1) expose students to mediation practice, early dispute resolution (EDR), and general negotiation techniques; and (2) provide students with the skills needed to represent clients effectively in mediation.
