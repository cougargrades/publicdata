      The vast majority of day-to-day disputes are resolved (formally and informally) without litigation. This survey course focuses on introducing students to some of the most common processes involved in so-called “alternative” dispute resolution, including negotiation, mediation, and arbitration. In addition to the legal foundations of these processes, the course emphasizes psychological insights and practical strategies for lawyers.
