      The purpose of this class is to learn about the use of experiments in political science, to develop an understanding of the experimental method (e.g., its strengths and weaknesses compared to other methodologies), and to gain experience designing your own experimental study. This is an applied course, which means that you will be reading examples of experimental work in political science and other fields. We will cover a variety of types of experiments, as well as a variety of substantive applications, though with an emphasis on behavioral research.
