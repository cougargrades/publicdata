      This interdisciplinary course focuses on the increasing recognition that the design of communities and of buildings can impact human health, especially among disadvantaged populations. Community designs that feature parks, sidewalks, trails, public transit, access to healthy food, and connectivity among destinations can promote equity, encourage physical activity, help prevent obesity and its associated health consequences, and reduce dependence on automobiles whose use contributes to air pollution, motor vehicle crashes, and pedestrian injuries. Increased attention to the health implications of the built environment has led to various innovative solutions, such as mixed-use Smart Growth developments, investments in bicycling and pedestrian infrastructure, incentives to reduce gentrification, and the use of health impact assessments to convey health information to community decision-makers. Course Notes: All readings will be provided on Canvas:  Textbook:  Making Healthy Places: Designing and Building for Health, Well-Being, and Sustainability, 2nd edition. Nisha Botchwey, Andrew Dannenberg, Howard Frumkin. Island Press, 2022.  Additional readings (including chapters from the 1st edition of MHP) will be provided on Canvas.
