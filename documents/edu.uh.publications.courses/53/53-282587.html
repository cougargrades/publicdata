      In this graduate seminar and workshop, students will explore the range of research and writing strategies that have informed the writing of Autobiography of Cotton, a book that explores the participation of both human and non-human actors in the making of the cotton border between Texas and Tamaulipas in the early twentieth century. The course will devote time to revising the uses of archival and sensory ethnographic materials in historical, ethnographic, literary, and artistic inquiries. It will  link these practices to current discussions on new materialisms, realisms, and what is called geological writing. The course will interrogate the notions of cross-genre, creative non-fiction, crónica, and personal essay as writing strategies that might complement (rather than oppose) academic writing, and will analyze contemporary works  ̶  both in the literary and academic fields  ̶  in close dialogue with this Autobiography of Cotton. Participation in this class will require students to work with a set of primary sources or documents of their choosing. In addition to leading a discussion on a selected book, students will turn in a final cross-genre piece. Because this class is both a graduate seminar and workshop, students will be expected to turn in original materials and response letters for each author on a weekly basis.
