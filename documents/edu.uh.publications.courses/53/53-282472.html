      Introduction to selected topics in the history, theory, and criticism of the human-impacted environment. Lectures provide a thematic introduction to major issues, events, and actors within the history of the design disciplines in particular architecture, interior architecture, environmental design, and industrial design. Weekly sessions are organized around topical social and cultural concerns that affect the human-made and human-impacted environment and connect across the design disciplines. The course relies on critical reading, discussion, and research as means to develop the tools of historical observation, description, and reflection that underlay critical thinking and practice in the design fields.
