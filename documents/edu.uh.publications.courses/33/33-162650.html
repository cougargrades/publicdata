      Classical and modern spectroscopic methods for elemental and isotope analysis; emphasis on instrumentation and application to Earth Science problems.
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Note:
      </strong>
      Topics include: ICP-OES spectroscopy, Q-ICP-MS spectroscopy, QQQ-ICP-MS, LA-ICP-MS, MC-ICP-MS and TIMS. Analytical Methods in Inorganic Geochemistry is designed as an overview of the principles of Emmision Spectrometry and Mass Spectrometry; detailed operational practice training of available instruments in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences including sample preparation (Fusion, Acid Digestion and Laser Ablation), Instrument Operation; Data Reduction and Evaluation.  Secondly, it is also designed to give background and context to publish data sets for peer reviewed publication and graduate thesis.
