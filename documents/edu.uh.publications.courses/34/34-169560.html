       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Introduction to basic elements of fiction: evocative detail, dialogue, point-of-view, characterization, and narrative structure, among others. Readings will include major works in the literary cannon (Kafka, Chejov, Borges, Atwood, ) as well as a substantial portion (more than 50%) of works authored by Spanish and Latin American writers (in English translation) in connection with Hispanic and Chicano/Latino authors in the United States. We will discuss this range of short fiction in class, providing too an opportunity to experience in context some of the techniques that will figure in the course. This class promotes the idea that writing is community making in a variety of ways. Taught in English.
