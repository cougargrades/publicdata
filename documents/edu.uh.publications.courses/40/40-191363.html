      This course hopes to guide graduate students to examine the changing literary and cultural trends in modern China by guiding them to do thesis research. By reading representative literature of various genres (short stories, novels, poetry, etc.) and films throughout the 20th and 21st century, we will trace the social-political and cultural transformation of the Chinese society. The course focuses on various important themes and debates in modern Chinese literature and films such as nationalism, gender, race and class. Students can choose to do research on specific writer or specific period of literature.
