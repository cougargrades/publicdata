      A doctoral Seminar with three objectives: to familiarize first year doctoral students with various paradigms in accounting research, providing students with an overview of the state of research in each field of interest to our faculty, and the important research questions being actively pursued in these fields; to offer our faculty the opportunity to inform the students of their own specific research interests and describe the projects on which they are currently working; and to assist students in the selection of an area in which to undertake a summer research project jointly with a faculty member.
